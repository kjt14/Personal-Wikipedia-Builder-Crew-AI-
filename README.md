 Personal Wikipedia Builder Crew â€” AI Wiki Article Generator

This project is an AI-powered system that generates personalized Wikipedia-style articles from user-provided topics or keywords. It combines advanced natural language generation with real-time semantic search to create accurate, well-structured content.

The frontend uses **Gradio** to deliver a responsive, interactive web interface where users input queries and receive detailed wiki-like articles instantly.

 How It Works

 **User Input:** Enter a topic or keyword via the Gradio UI.
 **Data Retrieval:** `duckducksearch` fetches relevant contextual information to ground the article in real-world data.
 **Content Generation:**

  The `openai` API generates coherent, human-like text.
  `crewai` enhances AI collaboration and advanced text synthesis.
   `langchain` orchestrates the workflow, chaining search results and generation for well-structured outputs.
 **Output:** Cleanly formatted Wikipedia-style articles rendered in the UI.
